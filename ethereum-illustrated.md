The document (https://github.com/takenobu-hs/ethereum-evm-illustrated) is very helpful during my ethereum learning process. I follow the flow of this slides and give more detailed introduction for my study. 

# Introduction

Ethereum can be considerred as a transaction-based state machine. The state for the ethereum is called the world state and the transaction is the state transition function. The world state transite from state S(t) to S(t+1) by taking one transaction. Transactions are collated into blocks. A block contains a list of transactions. From the viewpoint of the states, ethereum can be seen as a state chain and the transactions in one block decide the state transition together. From the viewpoint of the implementation, ethereum can also been considerred as chain of blocks, so it is BLOCKCHAIN. From the viewpoint of the leger, ethereum can also be seen as a stack of transactions (from genesis block to the latest block).
